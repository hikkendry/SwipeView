A fork of [cubiq/SwipeView](https://github.com/cubiq/SwipeView) specifically for use with Responsive Swipe (not yet published.)

- Uses a pre-existing HTML structure, rather than creating one.
- Removes mouse gesture pseudo-swipes.
- Adds [patch](https://github.com/kpuputti/SwipeView/commit/65eb7c31ad5d0890c12fb2aea24916a4669b0db1) to correct out-of-sync page indices when dragged past threshold and back.
